    "description": "This plugin allows you to display timestamps in a less exact, more readable format such as:\n- \"3 days ago\"\n- \"in a couple of hours\"\n- \"a year ago\"\n- \"just now\"\n\nUsers input a start date/time and an end date/time, the plugin calculates the difference in time and returns it as a text string. An empty start or end value will register as the current date/time. \n\nLibrary: https://github.com/philbooth/vagueTime.js",
